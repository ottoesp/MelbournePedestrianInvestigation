# Melbourne Pedestrian Investigation (WIP)

This is a statistical investigation based on the City of Melbourne pedestrian counting system. I am trying to isolate (to the
the effect of the pandemic period on pedestrian traffic and quantify our changing trends in the city (such as remote learning and working from home). 

As an undergraduate maths student this has really extended my knowledge from uni, involving some new statistical techniques such as Linear Mixed Models. 

I'm still working on this but if you want to have a look my main branch is hosted [here](ottoesperson.com), feel free to check out my progress :)
